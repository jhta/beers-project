## Beers web 

### How to run it:

`yarn install`

`yarn dev`

### Running in Prod

`yarn install`

`yarn build`

`yarn start`


### Technology:

* React Hooks (v16.8)
* Redux as Hook with redux-actions, reselect and react-use-redux, redux-saga
* Tests with Jest
* SSR and routing with Next.js
* Eslint config with Prettier and Standard.js
* theme/styling system using Rebass, Styled-system and Styled-components
* manage envitoments with DotEnv

For this I used my custom boilderplate: https://github.com/jhta/react-redux-boilerplate


### What I consider?

* UX and Final user interface
* Responsive based on Mobile first (thanks styled-sytem :) )
* Progressive enhancement
* Server rendering getting the all first impretion from html. That improve the performance and SEO
* User interface states
* Easy routing (thanks nextjs)
* Separate the services logic
* Clean code
* Multiple enviroments (dev, prod)
* Styling based on defined theme
* Modularity and testeability for all: libs, reducers, sagas, services, etc.
* Manipulate the favorites with localstorage, creating a fabric method for access and manipulate it

### What I miss? (For time)
* Testing (integration, unit testing, end-to-end). Normally I priorize to make integration test
* I18n
* A11y
* Test Coverage
